TITLE Getting Started

TEXT --{
The first thing you have to do is creating a content pack. A content pack is a container for all the things you \
may create. You can create as many as you like, for example to have things separated.
The pack won't appear in the list until you restart the game!
The name of the pack can be chosen freely but the ID must not contain any spaces and has to be unique among other packs \
and mods.

If you choose "tutorial" as the packs ID or if there is only one pack, links will bring you to the correct screen using that pack.

BUTTON "Create Pack" ::newPack

TEXT --{

If you open the pack, you'll see a list with all things you can create. Clicking any of these will bring you to a list \
that contains all creations of said type. You can add, remove and most of the time also edit them.
Most things don't require a restart of the game to appear (and disappear). Exceptions are, for example, blocks and items.
